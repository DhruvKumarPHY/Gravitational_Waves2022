Handling Big Chunks Of DATA taken from LIGO and Virgo detectors to derive meaningful conclusions.   




General relativity explains gravity in terms of a dynamical spacetime, where changes in the gravitational field propagate as waves. These waves are generated by the bulk acceleration of matter and they travel at the speed of light. We want to understand the nature of these gravitational waves,1 explain how they are generated, and discuss how they move through spacetime. These are all important steps.
In order to model astrophysical sources we need to understand what gravitational waves are and how they are generated. We need to establish how they carry energy from the source to our detectors, what effect this has on the source, and how a wave passing through our instruments affects them. We need to know to what extent the waves are altered as they travel through the Universe, e.g. via gravitational lensing or through interaction with the interstellar medium. If the waves are of cosmological origin we also need to weigh in the fact that the Universe evolves.
